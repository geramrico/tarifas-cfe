#Federal Electricity Comission - Energy Supply Tariffs in Mexico

This app allows its users to quickly check Mexico's Federal Electricity Comission's energy supply tariffs and get an estimate on how much a load will for for utilities on a given month. 

Data is updated monthly (you can find the CSV in this repo), I'll try to keep it always on par with the latest info.

Some things I learned with this project:

 - How to efficiently get cell values within a Pandas DataFrame
 - How _caching_ works
 - Better understanding of the frontend-backend interaction
 - How to set up a project
 - Git workflow

***
The app was built with Python and [Streamlit](streamlit.io), which is amazing and I highly recommend to get projects going incredibly fast.
